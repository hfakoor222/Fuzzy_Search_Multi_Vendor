Program searches routers and switches for fuzzy matches.
User inputs  +   and   (())   control characters in a notepad file, along with bare bones configuration templates, the program does fuzzy searching.  + is equal to search anything non-greedy,  and (())  is equal to any 
characters no spaces. This gives the user absolute control in template definition.

has been tested on Cisco routers, switches, and ASAv. I will be uploading code for Junos scraping soon, and also a video of the code working against ASA (tested last night).


refer to "config_documentation.txt"   for instructions
and the template+config.py file
